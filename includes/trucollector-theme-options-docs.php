<p>It got a bit much to update this information in the theme. Please see <a href="https://github.com/cogdog/tru-collector#setting-up-the-site-via-tru-collector-options" target="_blank">the documentation on configuring the Collector options hosted in GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>For complete setup documentation that includes suggestions for setup, plugins, <a href="https://github.com/cogdog//tru-collector">see the theme repository on GitHub</a>. That is also <a href="https://github.com/cogdog//tru-collector/issues">a good place to ask question or toss accolades</a>.</p>
